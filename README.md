This project is intended to provide an easy to use management software for small non profit clubs/associations.

The name is a joke based on the german term Vereinsmeier or Vereinsmeierei which is a term for a person or attitude putting to much emphasis on the function and processes in a club.

It is a hobby project created for personal reasons and goals (as i am in the board of a club) and will be treated as such.

Coarse goals:
* Restricted login
  * This software is supposed to provide a private "back office" for the club and should only allow access to members of the club.
  * Furthermore there should be varying levels of access to the data, e.g. only the board should be able to retrieve all personal information of all members.
* Member management
  * First and foremost the software needs to provide a database for all currently active members and their contact information.
  * Further useful features include:
    * tracking of membership duration
    * tracking of membership fees
* Event management
  * Display all upcoming events
  * export events as updating? vcal or other importable format
  * send reminders of events
* Issue tracking
  * Every club has some chores to do and it would be nice to be able to track them and assign them to members
* Votes
  * There might be the need for informal votes on some topics like on what activities to be planned, restaurants to go to, timeslots for those events
  * Out of scope are votes of legal importance(laws, bylaws, articles of association)
